# IRIS EDA
In the above jupyter notebook I have done exploratory data analysis on the Iris dataset. My first step in the data visualization process is to preprocess the iris dataset and then use seaborn to visualize the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a technique to analyze data using some visual Techniques. With this technique, we can get detailed information about the statistical summary of the data. We will also be able to deal with the duplicates values, outliers, and also see some trends or patterns present in the dataset.
Iris dataset contains five columns namely â€“ Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width, and Species Type. Iris is a flowering plant, the researchers have measured various features of the different iris flowers and recorded them digitally.
